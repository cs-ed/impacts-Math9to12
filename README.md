# Impacts on Society

Introduction to Data Science is a course open to juniors and seniors in my school district. This course builds coding experience on the platform of the R coding language in parallel to foundational statistics following the data cycle. In this impact plan, students learn to use coding and their growing understanding of statistics to follow the data cycle by first asking a statistical question, collecting data, analyzing that collected data, and interpreting the coded analysis. This plan will invite students of various learning levels (Special Education, English Learners, etc.) to start by looking at common everyday activities that involve nutrition, use of time, personality, and more to culminate towards their own semester-end projects covering areas of teen wellness and societal impacts of technology on teens. Ultimately the goal is to build a stronger consciousness and conscientiousness of how technology impacts our students and fits into their academic and non-academic lives. As existing users of technology, our teens will build more than a conscious awareness but a societal responsibility of its utilization within a community and beyond.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

- Recognize concern(s) within a community (within student’s grade levels or age group) to seek out answers.
- Ask a statistical questi on to research a topic of concern that impacts the student.
- Develop survey questions encompassing the research topic to ask a relevant group (i.e. peers).
- Analyze collected data from measurable information gathered from surveys using the R coding platform to create visual representations (such as histograms, bar graphs, scatter plots, etc.).
- Interpret the resulting numerical and categorical data in its visual forms to answer the statistical question.
- Present this research and analysis to the class as a final project to explain findings.
- Compare what was learned from existing research articles found on the topic to distinguish similarities and differences.


### Learning Activities

- Initially in this data science course students learn first to build their knowledge of the R coding language to analyze existing data.
- Gradually students are guided in answering pre-created surveys on relevant topics such as their nutrition habits, time usage, personality types in order to build and reinforce the R code while analyzing the graphs and plots produced.
- Students learn to create a campaign of survey questions relevant to their chosen research topic using the course-provided platform of the Campaign Manager as well as utilizing Google Forms.
- The aforementioned activities happen while students’ knowledge of foundational statistics is being built and expanded through more informal surveys and with guided analysis of the results.
- In between the coding activities and statistics lessons are discussions of the analyzed results where students are asked to consider if data gathered from their class would reflect loosely or more closely to that of teens on campus and on a wider scale across the state and/or nation.
- Students are prompted also to look for anomalies that skew the data in the form of outliers, which might result from peers who misread a question by answering in hours instead of minutes.
- Homework is incorporated in the lab responses in their Google documents and in their codes entered to verify they have actually generated a visual representation of the analyzed variable. 
- Furthermore after students look through the visual plots and answer basic questions checking their comprehension, they are then asked to apply what they have found on a larger scale of society in topics such as nutrition and time usage.
- At the end of the grading periods, students reflect in writing on what they have learned and what has impacted them personally or individually as well as on broader basis in the teen community and/or the community they reside in.
- Informal quizzes are administered to assess knowledge of coding skills as well as the foundational statistics concepts all the coding is based upon.


### Assessment

- A month before the end of the first semester, data science students start a final project which is presented on the day of their final. They are given the choice to work along or with a peer and choose a topic for which they develop a statistical question. The overall theme concerns teen wellness. A scaffolded guideline is provided so students know what is expected as well as a calendar to guide their progress in class. None of the statistical questions can be duplicated, so students are encouraged to research something they care about or are interested in. In general my students choose to concentrate on either teen emotional wellness or teen physical wellness, so within them are a nearly endless amount of interested topics from which to choose. Students survey their peers and a specific number of peers outside of the class after they formulate their survey questions. In the end the entire data cycle is represented and presented on the day of the final as a set of Google Slides. Within this presentation is also the requirement for students to cite and speak to a reputable article addressing their topic, and then to compare their analysis and interpretation to that of the article’s. Students are encouraged to bring up similarities and differences as well as what contributed to the differences. Most students enter into their projects with an expectation of results based mostly on their own experience and thoughts, however they are prompted in the project guidelines to discuss the findings that were expected as well as those that were surprisingly unexpected. In this project, my students are able to see how technology impacts areas of wellness they care about when it comes to collected data where that information can sometimes be biased due to the methods of sampling. 
- In the 2 to 3 weeks of the second semester, students embark on a project relating directly to technology with a survey of preconstructed questions in regards to their phone use. The questions cover areas of phone use covering audio media, video media, social media, and more. Students will be instructed to construct a research question relating to the smart phone’s society impact on teens. They will be asked to find at least one reputable article that discusses the topic but then to use the data gathered from those survey questions in the R coding platform to construct visual plots and graphs to answer their statistical question. Again they will go through the data cycle and represent (and present) this through a set of Google Slides. Students are expected to critique their results as they compare their findings among their peers to that of the articles cited. In their conclusion students will not only interpret their results to answer their research question, but they will also examine the overall impact of that area of smart phone technology on society with the teen subgroup and as a larger group in our community. 
- Both of these Semester-end assessments are projects where the guidelines provided show students the breakdown of points allotted for each part of the data cycle (1. Ask a question, 2. Collect data, 3. Analyze the data, 4. Interpret the data) as well as contrasting and comparing their own findings with that of an article covering a broader population. Both projects will include slides that include screenshots of relevant plots and graphs generated by the R coding platform along with the codes entered. Ultimately all these pieces come together in a reflective conclusion when students speak to what they have learned after pointing out all the measurable proof that answers their question.


### Outcomes

- This plan has been used and it has continued to evolve over the six years I have taught this introduction to data science course. It has been created with every student of various backgrounds and learning levels in mind.
- Over the years I have had English learners who have found the topics universally appealing as technology and all its forms of media have similar impacts across languages and cultures.
- For my Special Education students the guidelines for the assessments as well as the coding and statistics lessons are heavily scaffolded, and the initial topics of nutrition and time use then leading to these final projects of teen wellness and phone usage’s impacting teens have appealed as relatable topics and areas of interest. 
- For the semester-end projects students are allowed to work individually or with a peer, and it is in partnerships that form between students of different learning abilities and backgrounds that I have observed many “aha” moments. Their collaboration and discussion of their own expectations and experiences among themselves and then through their presentations are insightful to the class as they see their own experiences reflected in the articles they cite covering a broader group. It is these “aha” moments that I often see in the students who do the presentations that ultimately show me that they see technology’s impact as more than just an individual effect with some presenting ideas and solutions that might impact society.
